# Week 7

Question 1.3:
The PCA plot does not look okay. Based on the clusters, it looks like for Replicate 2, the tissue labels for LFC.Fe and 
Fe were swapped for some reason.

  
The tissue specific gene expression explains the majority of the first principal component because based on the pca plot, we see that the 21 samples sepearate 
along the x axis based on the tissue type somewhat nicely. Since the principal components represent the 500
most differentially expressed genes, the way the tissues drive separation of the samples on the PCA plot
is through the differntial gene expression conferred by the tissue type.

Question 3:

Cluster 1 has an enriched GO term for proteolysis. This makes sense because this cluster of genes is most highly expressed in
copper cells, which is an acidic region of the Drosophila digestive system which would likely also want to release
proteases to digest proteins, which work better in acidic conditions.

CLuster 3 is has enriched GO terms for epithelial cell development. This makes sense because the tissues that express this the most,
A1, A2, and A3, are gut epithelial cells that likely have stem cells replenishing the cells facing the lumen.
