Samples 1, 3, and 4 are haplotype R while samples 2, 5, and 6 are haplotype B on the chr1 stretch of 27000 to 32000.

On IGV, the visualization shows many colors for mismatches to the reference on samples 1, 3, 4 from chr1:27000-32000 on both the coverage plots and aligned reads, while samples 2, 5, and 6 don't have many as mismatches to the reference in this chromosome region. Therefore, the reference genome for S. cerevisiae sacCer3 is based on haplotype B.
